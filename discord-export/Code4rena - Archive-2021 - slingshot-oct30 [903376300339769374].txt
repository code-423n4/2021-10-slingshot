Just thought you should know abt this `This repo will be made public before the start of the contest. (C4 delete this line when made public)`

@🐺wardens The Slingshot contest is now **closed**! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

**What's next:** the Slingshot team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. We'll announce awards 🤑🏆 in #🐺wardens, and keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping an organizer if you have questions along the way!

Hey I was hoping to speak with someone regarding a submission I made... I feel like I could have added more info to one them. Please let me know who the best contact would be 😄

Hi! You can DM me or @itsmetechjay | C4 . Might take us a day or so to respond as we're getting a contest ready to launch, but we're happy to help 🙂


[03-Nov-21 03:00 PM] elprofesor#7324
sweet is this going to be the same answer in every contest? or does it vary depending on who the judges are?


[03-Nov-21 03:01 PM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Judges make the final calls, so there could be some variance. But lemme find out more context before I answer. 🙂
